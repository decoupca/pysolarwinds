# In most cases, resource import takes 10-90 seconds. But

# To prevent triggering false positive alerts during resource import,
# it makes sense to unmanage the node during the process. When the import
# completes, the node will be re-managed right away. But, if the resource
# import fails (e.g, due to timeout or other unhandled exception), the node
# will remain unmanaged indefinitely without this failsafe. In testing we found
# that remediating nodes with failed imports can take longer than expected,
# so it's sensible to give ourselves plenty of time before the node re-manages
# itself.
